Unity Game
Zhao is a puzzle game, with the theme of exploring and solving mazes. You will control Zhao to find chests and the exit for the most difficult mazes in the world.
In Zhao, players take on the role of a character equipped with a dagger, battling various enemies like rats while exploring an environment filled with destructible objects like CrackWalls. The gameplay centers on fast-paced combat, where the player must attack strategically, utilizing a cooldown mechanic between strikes. The enemies react dynamically, chasing and attacking the player once they enter their range.

The game also features a UI that displays health updates in real-time, with damage numbers floating up when enemies or objects are struck. Players need to manage their attacks carefully to survive, using visual cues and animations to anticipate enemy actions. With simple controls, an immersive environment, and particle effects that enhance the feel of destruction and combat, Zhao challenges players to stay sharp and focused in their encounters.
